            At Mozilla, we believe you have a right to privacy. You shouldn’t be
            tracked online. Whether you are checking your bank balance, looking
            for the best doctor, or shopping for shoes, unscrupulous tracking
            companies should not be able to track you as you browse the Web. For
            that reason, we are continuously working to harden Firefox against
            online tracking of our users.

          We take the long view of our connections and interactions, both with
          each other and with the people who use our products. This requires a
          commitment to empathy, active listening and giving without the
          expectation of getting. It’s digging in to understand what makes
          people tick and caring about that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transparent and open processes are a unique part of our genetic code.
          When coupled with responsible participation — being generous and kind
          with both our inputs and our outputs — we create trust and
          accountability and elevate the quality of our decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are here to do hard things, take on giants and make a difference in
          people’s online lives — so we must have grit. Having grit means facing
          obstacles with optimism, determination to find new ways forward and
          being relentless about learning from what worked and what didn’t.
